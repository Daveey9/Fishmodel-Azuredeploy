Species, Weight, Length 1, Length 2, Length 3, Height, Width and has 160 data entries. Heroku's deployment of an ML model To predict the type of fish based on 
parameters like weight, length, height, and width, a random classifier model is created for the fish dataset.

I have built a ML model for the Fish market dataset. 
A model.pk file was used to save the model.

# Deployment
The Microsoft Azure cloud platform has been used to host my application online.
